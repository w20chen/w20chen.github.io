### 黑水
夜色中的火车轰隆作响，<br>
湿漉漉的黑色枝条从雪地裏伸出。<br>
这是一个只有两种色彩的地方，<br>
男人的眼前交替出现黑白幻象。<br>
<br>
夜色裏，<br>
黑色溪流发出不眠的梦呓。<br>
男人紧裹衣裳；<br>
战士抿着薄酒；<br>
诗人展开破舊卷边的纸张。<br>
<br>
火车正行驶在地图的边缘，<br>
男人来到地图空荡荡的一方。<br>
那裏只有一行的模糊的铅字，<br>
只有一行铅字標记他的故鄉。<br>
<br>
男人佇立在小火车站的一隅，<br>
角落裏的水管，水滴嘀嗒地响。<br>
污浊的水流在雪地裏迴迂。<br>
<br>
过往并非只能在纸上沉淀，<br>
可是文字往往最令人信服。<br>
倾斜的字迹诉说着男人的童年，<br>
即便是荒谬也珍贵弥足。<br>
<br>
倾斜的字迹诉说着男人的童年，<br>
除了“恨”和“爱”更有一些生僻的字眼。<br>
谁能想到复杂而抽象的概念，<br>
总让人做出简单而直接的择选？<br>
<br>
男人走在雪地裏，戴着针织帽，<br>
短短的胡髭也附著冰霜。<br>
他在结白的雪地裏留下灰色的脚印，<br>
他在晦暗的雪地裏留下脚印，<br>
走进夜色。远处隐有白亮的火光。<br>
<br>
他想起自己从未见过的战争：<br>
黑色的痂、河流和火车。<br>
他闻到远处飘来的火焰的气息，<br>
回头望向身后的足迹：<br>
月色中，脚印似乎突起。<br>
<br>
生命是一条黑色的溪流<br>
——虽没有镣铐，但也远非自由。<br>
“这些一向如此，<br>
可我的一生从未如此惬意，“<br>
男人咳嗽着地说道，<br>
“这足以说明，<br>
没有一种精神应被唾弃，<br>
即便非黑即白的精神也是如此。“<br>
<br>
四野裏只有空空的雪地，<br>
男人开始奔跑……<br>



### Black Water
The train was roaring in the night.<br>
Wet black branches protruded from the white.<br>
That was a place with only two colors.<br>
Black and white visions alternated before a man's eyes.<br>
<br>
The black stream sent out endless somniloquy that night.<br>
The man wrapped his clothes tight.<br>
The soldier sipped his wine.<br>
The poet unfolded some worn paper under the moonlight.<br>
<br>
The train was running on the edge of the map.<br>
The man came to an empty part of the map.<br>
There was only one line of fuzzy words.<br>
His hometown was marked with only one line of words.<br>
<br>
The man stands in a corner of the small railway station.<br>
A water pipe in the corner was leaking.<br>
Dirty water swirled in the snow.<br>
<br>
The past is not only carried by paper,<br>
But words are often the most convincing.<br>
Slanting handwriting talked about the man's childhood<br>
\- Absurd and yet precious.<br>
<br>
Slanting handwriting talked about the man's childhood, there,<br>
In addition to "hatred" and "love", were some rare<br>
Words. Who can believe that complex and abstract noises<br>
Can always let people make simple and straight-forward choices.<br>
<br>
The man walked in the snow with a knitted hat.<br>
His short moustache was also covered with frost.<br>
He left footprints in the white snow.<br>
He left footprints in dark shadow.<br>
And there's a fire in the distance.<br>
<br>
He thought of a war he'd never seen:<br>
Black scabs, rivers and trains.<br>
He smelt of the fire in the distance,<br>
And looked back at the footprints behind:<br>
In the moonlight, footprints seemed to protrude.<br>
<br>
A black stream - it is life.<br>
Although there're no shackles, it's far from freedom.<br>
"I've never been so pleased in my life,"<br>
The man coughed and said,<br>
"That's enough to say,<br>
No spirit should be despised,<br>
Even the spirit of either-black-or-white is the same."<br>
<br>
There was nothing but snow in the man's sight.<br>
He started running...<br>
