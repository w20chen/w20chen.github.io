<p>
Like we said, we’re looking into this Hoffman and Fensky thing. Whatever you can tell us – anything at all. <br>
Hold on hold on, Hoffman and Fensky, _____________. Assume I know ______________________, all right? Start at the beginning. Seriously? Look, don’t let Mr. Ehrmantraut’s dancing eyes and bubbly, bon vivant personality fool you. He’s actually - _______________- somewhat taciturn. Shall I fan you gently, so you don’t go into shock. ______________, okay? We’re talking Book of Genesis.<br>
Okay, Mr. McGill, as you probably gathered, we – Detective Sanders and I – work for the Philadelphia Police Department, as did Mr. Ehrmantraut _______________. <br>
Philadelphia? Go, eagles. <br>
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt. He, too, was with Philly P.D. He was a rookie officer with about two years on the job.<br>
_____________________.<br>
Yes, he was. About nine months ago, he responded to a ___________________ in some west side rattrap. Matt went in with his partner, officer Troy Hoffman. They had Sergeant Jack Fensky ______________. _______________, things got _____________. Three of them were _____________ and Matt didn’t make it out. Hoffman and Fensky returned fire, but the shooter ______________. We chased a few leads, shook up the _________________ - came up short. <br>
_________________________.<br>
Anyway, we kept beating ______________, kept coming up dry until three months ago. That’s when Hoffman and Fensky both turned up dead in a vacant lot in nicetown, again, an ambush of some kind, it looks like. And with _________ killed Matt out there in the wind, we’re thinking – well, it’s our operating _______ that Hoffman and Fensky were mixed up in with something, _______________, and maybe that ________________. <br>
Sorry, I go to do my lawyer thing here. What does my client have to do with any of this? <br>
Mike, this is a Hail Mary, beyond that. If we _________________________ or leads, we _______________. There’s anything you can tell us about what Hoffman and Fensky were into? <br>
Help us out, Mike. Help us catch the bastard who killed Matt. <br>
I don’t know much about Hoffman and Fensky. They were Matt’s people. _______________________. I saw them in a bar the night they died. It was McClure’s – Maybe the Red Dog – probably McClure’s.<br>
__________________________________?<br>
It’s a cop bar. They were drinking with everyone. <br>
___________________________________________________?<br>
I couldn’t tell you. I was… You know how I was. <br>
__________________________________________?<br>
Feeling like I crawled out from __________________________ and working hard to stay there.<br>
Although I’ve got to say. It doesn’t help much, dredging up the past like this.<br>
Let me ask you, _________________________ to Albuquerque?<br>
It couldn’t have been too much later.<br>
_________________________________.<br>
The day after Hoffman and Fensky died?<br>
You didn’t think to, stick around once you ___________________?<br>
I don’t think I heard the news till I was west of Kansas City.<br>
Still, you didn’t _______________________, correct?<br>
Even though Hoffman was Matt’s partner?<br>
Do you remember __________________________________?<br>
Did you ______________________________?<br>
Sorry. I got nothing. They weren’t my people. I’m sorry you guys took a flier on me. I wish _____________. <br>
That’s it? Are we done here?<br>
We are done here, yeah.</p>

<p>
You let some things slides and _______________. You bust a __________ that has more cash than you’ll ever earn ___________. Some of it doesn’t make it back into ______ - ______? You take a taste.  ______________. That’s how you knew _____________. It’s like killing Caesar - ______________.<br>
Matt wasn’t dirty. I was. Everyone was in that precinct. That’s _______________.<br>
You ________ your buddy, you’re ______________. You go along to __________. And you went along.<br>
I did. Yeah, I did.<br>
Okay, but you said Matt didn’t.<br>
No. Not Matt.<br>
Fensky got to Hoffman early. Kickbacks from some gang or another, protection, __________. And Hoffman went to Matty and _______________.<br>
Only fair, right? They were _________.<br>
And Matt did what you would think. He agonized. And then he came to me, wanted to go to the I.A., __________________.<br>
Oh my God, you let him? That’s why he got killed. Because he was gonna _________________?<br>
No, no.</p>


### 37:15
<p>
I told him… You know what a cop fears most? More than getting shit, more than anything?<br>
_______. Getting locked up with everybody you put away.<br>
You _______ a cop with that, you make him _________.<br>

He had _______________. Take the money. Do something good with it.<br>
Well, I tried. I tried. But he ____________. My boy was stubborn. My boy was _________. And __________________________.<br>
So I told him…I told him I did it, too.

He _________ on a pedestal and I had to show him that I was down in the gutter with _____________. ______ my boy. I _____ my boy. <br>
He went to Hoffman, he took the money, but he _________. Even looking like you’re doing _________________ meant that he wasn’t solid, that he couldn’t be__________. I got Matty to take the money. And they killed him ___________. He was ______________________________. He’d never have done it, not even to _______________. I was the only one that could get him to _______________ like that. And it was ______________. I made him lesser. I made him _______. And the bastards killed him ______.  <br>

<p>
I know this is __________________________________.<br>
I think your chances of getting a ________ ruling from a jury are very ______.<br>
What does that mean?<br>
We are not in a great _______ to win at trail.<br>
But we came to you people because we were told _______________.<br>
Winning doesn’t always mean getting a favorable verdict ___________.<br>
We try to achieve the best possible ________ for our clients, given each ________ case.<br>
Frankly, we’ve worked very hard to stave off _______________.<br>
After the _____________ about your camping trip, the D.A. was ________ you might be a flight risk.<br>
A flight risk?<br>
We were ________________________________.<br>
That’s exactly what we told the D.A.<br>
In any case, I think we’ve managed to come up with a deal that is very favorable ______________________.<br>
A deal? I hate that terminology.<br>
A deal is what they got O.J.<br>
I am just saying, it’s a terrible term.<br>
What kind of deal?<br>
If the prosecution decides to file, which is _______ the direction this seems to be headed, and if they choose to stack charges, Craig, you are looking at ______________________.</p>


### 16:47
<p>
30 years?<br>
That’s the ___________, and given the nature of the _______ and ______________________, I’d say we should expect it.<br>
The public outcry in cases like these is a big ________.<br>
However, after much discussion with the D.A., who is also invested in keeping the press to a ___________, we’ve arrived at an arrangement, which would include _____ months in a county facility.<br>
______ months.<br>
Down from ______ years.<br>
And you most likely wouldn’t serve _________.<br>
But he would have to say ____________.<br>
Admitting wrongdoing and making the county whole again goes a long way here – hence the ____________________.</p>


### 17:23
<p>
It includes the stipulation that you return $_________ in misappropriated funds.<br>
But there’s no money. We told you Craig is _____________.<br>
I understand. However, I’d like to _____________ again that this deal is Craig’s best chance of ______________________.<br>
You are telling us there are ____________ and _____________ walking the streets, but instead of going after them, they want to __________________________________.<br>
There’s no other way?<br>
I am sorry. I think, under the ________________, this is your __________________.<br>
______________ and _______________, and this is how they treat…<br>
Okay. There’s no money. __________. You have to take this to trail.<br>
Look, you have a difficult, but nevertheless ______________ choice to make here.<br>
___________, you give up the money.<br>
Plead guilty. It’s painful. I know. And go to jail for a year and a half.<br>
But your other choice – that is ___________________.<br>
If you go to trail, you’ll most likely lose, and Craig goes to prison for ________.</p>


### 18:30
<p>
Your children will grow up seeing their dad ________________ on visiting day.<br>
I know what I will do. I’d take the deal.<br>
Two years from now, you can be starting over.<br>
It’s tough, I know. But you are _______ people. And your family is _______ it.<br>
Why don’t I _____________________________ to discuss this? I know it’s a big decision.<br>
We don’t need to discuss it. You are fired.</p>



### 25:15
<p>
My schedule is just – it’s chock-full right now. I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.<br>
I am certain they would welcome you _____________________.<br>
We are not going back there. They were ______________.<br>
I understand. They asked you to face ______________________, and I get it. No one likes that. But the _____________ here – Kim Wexler is a fine ____________.<br>
She has a great relationship with the D.A.<br>
_____________ I’d love to sing my own praises; I doubt I could get you a deal _____________ the one she already has.<br>
We don’t want a deal. We want you, our lawyer, to exonerate Craig.<br>
Exonerate? That’s a big word, ____________________.<br>
There will be no deal. There’s no money with which to make a deal.<br>
Can we all three just _______ down from the cloud cuckoo land?</p>

### 26:17
<p>
Because we know, _____________________________________.<br>
I distinctly remember a spirited game of tug-of-war over this money. Money which we then discussed _______________.<br>
You made many ___________ justifying your __________ of said money. It's there. It exists.<br>
For my own sanity, you can’t hide a big bag of crash forever, and you certainly will never be able to spend any of it. So go back to HHM, apologize to Ms. Wexler, and for Christ’s sakes, take the deal. <br>
If ______________________, there ________________________ a full accounting of it. Every penny would have to be present.<br>
Every single penny. You understand?<br>
All of it that include the $30,000 that you...<br>
He gets it. We are in this together Mr. McGill. _________________.<br>
Now _____________?<br>
